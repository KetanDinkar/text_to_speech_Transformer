3|ljspeech|The sky is blue and the sun is shining
4|ljspeech|Can you hear me clearly now
5|ljspeech|This is a test for training my voice AI
6|ljspeech|The thin brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
7|ljspeech|Im trying to make my own text to speech model
8|ljspeech|Lets see how good this can get
9|ljspeech|Im really excited to hear my own voice generated by AI
10|ljspeech|Every journey starts with a single step
11|ljspeech|Wow that was amazing
12|ljspeech|Oh no I forgot my keys
13|ljspeech|Are you serious right now

27|ljspeech|Lets go home
28|ljspeech|Thank you so much for your help
29|ljspeech|I appreciate your support
30|ljspeech|Im learning how to code
31|ljspeech|Today was a good day
32|ljspeech|Have a Grate Day
33|ljspeech|Artificial intelligence is changing the world
34|ljspeech|I want to work in the game development industry
35|ljspeech|Machine learning helps computers learn from data
36|ljspeech|Python is a popular programming language
37|ljspeech|My goal is to build voice-based AI applications
38|ljspeech|I use Piper TTS to train my voice model
39|ljspeech|Training a model takes time and patience
40|ljspeech|Good audio quality makes a big difference
41|ljspeech|GPUs make training much faster
42|ljspeech|Voice AI is the future of interaction
43|ljspeech|One two three four five
44|ljspeech|Ten twenty thirty forty fifty
45|ljspeech|My birthday is on the fourteenth of September
46|ljspeech|The year is two thousand twenty-five
47|ljspeech|Let me spell my name: K E T A N
48|ljspeech|My college started in September last year
49|ljspeech|I have sixteen CPU threads and one GPU
50|ljspeech|The model size is around 28 million parameters
51|ljspeech|Training started at three forty-five PM
52|ljspeech|The result was saved in the output folder
53|ljspeech|Hmm maybe
54|ljspeech|Uh oh
55|ljspeech|Oh
56|ljspeech|No way
57|ljspeech|Yes definitely
58|ljspeech|Mm hmm

62|ljspeech|Thats it for now
63|ljspeech|Thankyou
64|ljspeech|What time is it right now
65|ljspeech|Can you show me the way
66|ljspeech|Where did you put the charger

68|ljspeech|Could you please repeat that
69|ljspeech|Turn off the lights before you leave
70|ljspeech|Stop right there
71|ljspeech|Dont forget to save your work
72|ljspeech|Open the door slowly
73|ljspeech|Let me know when you're read
74|ljspeech|Its raining heavily outside
75|ljspeech|The wind is really strong today
76|ljspeech|I love walking in the forest
77|ljspeech|Birds are chirping in the morning
78|ljspeech|The mountain view is breathtaking
79|ljspeech|The temperature dropped to five degrees
80|ljspeech|A rainbow appeared after the rain
81|ljspeech|The stars are shining bright tonight
82|ljspeech|Summer is my favorite season
83|ljspeech|Thunderstorms always scare me
84|ljspeech|Im working on a project that teaches a computer to speak like me using AI
85|ljspeech|Sometimes I wonder how machines can mimic human voices so accurately
86|ljspeech|If you listen carefully you can hear how the pitch and rhythm vary
87|ljspeech|My goal is to create something useful not just for myself but for others too
88|ljspeech|This is a long sentence to help the model understand my speaking style over time
89|ljspeech|Im truly grateful for everything Ive learned
90|ljspeech|That made me really angry
91|ljspeech|I felt so peaceful in that moment
92|ljspeech|My heart is filled with joy
93|ljspeech|Please dont be upset
94|ljspeech|I love you
95|ljspeech|I want to build an AI that can talk in games
96|ljspeech|Character voices should sound human not robotic
97|ljspeech|Imagine playing a game where every NPC has its own voice
98|ljspeech|I use Unity and Unreal Engine to explore game development
99|ljspeech|Im learning Python slowly but steadily
100|ljspeech|The AI engine is processing input commands
101|ljspeech|Real time rendering takes a lot of power
102|ljspeech|The FPS dropped because of high graphics load
103|ljspeech|Im designing a system that talks like me
104|ljspeech|The dataset should be clean and balanced
105|ljspeech|I didnt know anything about AI but now Im learning every day
106|ljspeech|Failure is part of the learning process
107|ljspeech|I want to make my parents proud
108|ljspeech|Theres a lot to learn but I enjoy the journey
109|ljspeech|My dream is to contribute something meaningful to the world
110|ljspeech|Serendipity is a beautiful word
111|ljspeech|The algorithm optimized the weights efficiently
112|ljspeech|Phenomenal results require constant effort
113|ljspeech|Silence is sometimes louder than words
114|ljspeech|I admire dedication and discipline
115|ljspeech|I studied at CSVTU Bhilai
116|ljspeech|Chhattisgarh is a beautiful state
117|ljspeech|My native language is Hindi but Im speaking in English here
118|ljspeech|I sometimes mix Hindi and English in my conversations
119|ljspeech|Thoda adjust kar lo is a common phrase in India
120|ljspeech|I you really give me one chance
121|ljspeech|Can we dance
122|ljspeech|Just one time
123|ljspeech|Holding each other hands
124|ljspeech|Ans just looking at each other eyes
125|ljspeech|Ans you me and music
126|ljspeech|I really love you
127|ljspeech|Because i don't know the reason
