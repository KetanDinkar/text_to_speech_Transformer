üß† MY MODEL: Tacotron2 + HiFi-GAN
You're using:

mathematica:-

Text Input ‚Üí Tacotron2 ‚Üí Mel Spectrogram ‚Üí HiFi-GAN ‚Üí Audio (WAV)

üîß COMPONENTS YOU USED TO CREATE YOUR MODEL:
1. Text Input (Your custom dataset)
Format: LJSpeech-style CSV: | id | text |
Purpose: Provides input sentences to teach the model how to pronounce words using your voice.
‚úÖ Your dataset has 127 samples, ~7 minutes of recorded audio in .wav format.

2. Tacotron2 (Your core model):-

üì¶ Neural network that converts text ‚Üí mel spectrogram.

üîç Modules Inside Tacotron2:
Module	Purpose
Text Encoder	Converts characters/phonemes into hidden features.
Attention Mechanism	Learns alignment between text and audio (which part of audio corresponds to which word).
Decoder	Generates mel spectrogram frames from the attention-guided hidden states.
Post-Net	A CNN that refines the mel spectrogram to be more natural.
Stop Token Head	Tells the model when to stop generating audio.

3. Loss Functions:-

These are used during training to teach the model what‚Äôs correct vs. wrong.

Loss Name	Meaning
decoder_loss	Difference between predicted and true mel spectrogram.
postnet_loss	Difference after postnet refinement.
stopnet_loss	Helps predict the end of speech.
ga_loss	Guides attention to move left-to-right.
ssim_loss	Compares shape/structure similarity of spectrograms.
avg_loss	Total combined loss to measure performance.

4. HiFi-GAN Vocoder (Waveform Generator):-

üì¶ Neural network that converts mel spectrogram ‚Üí real audio waveform (WAV).

‚úÖ You replaced Griffin-Lim with HiFi-GAN, which:
Produces realistic, high-quality speech
Is faster and clearer than older vocoders

5. Training Tools:-

You used several supporting tools:

Tool	Purpose
PyTorch	Main deep learning framework.
DataLoader	Loads your training and validation data efficiently.
Logger	Logs loss values, alignment, and saves best models.
Checkpoint Saver	Automatically saves best .pth models (like best_model_1056.pth).

6. Output FolderP:-

You chose:
D:/programs/python/Machine Learning/Text to speech 2/output/
It stores:

Trained models (*.pth)
Evaluation plots (alignment, audio)
Synthesized test outputs

7. Evaluation Test Sentences:-

The model periodically tries to synthesize test sentences.
It checks if speech quality is improving.

Phoneme input	Better clarity for complex words
Speaker embedding	Multi-speaker support
Emotion tags	Add expressive tone (e.g., happy, angry)
Pitch/Durational control	Control voice speed, emphasis, etc.
