🧪 Full Breakdown of EVAL PERFORMANCE Metrics
🕐 avg_loader_time
Copy
Edit
0.47068088395254953
What it means:
How much time (in seconds) it takes to load each batch during evaluation.
✅ Lower is better, but it’s not a quality metric — just how fast your system is reading data.

🎧 avg_decoder_loss
Copy
Edit
0.8721227305276054
What it means:
This is the main loss from predicting the mel-spectrogram from text.
It measures how close the predicted audio features are to the ground truth.
✅ Lower = better voice accuracy and pronunciation.

🎛 avg_postnet_loss
Copy
Edit
0.919401364667075
What it means:
This measures error after refinement by the post-net (a small CNN that improves mel prediction).
✅ Should reduce over time.
It should be similar to decoder_loss, sometimes slightly better.

🛑 avg_stopnet_loss
Copy
Edit
0.036844427564314434
What it means:
Measures how well the model predicts when to stop speaking.
✅ Lower is better.
If it's too high, the model might:
Talk too long
Get stuck at max_decoder_steps

🧬 avg_ga_loss
Copy
Edit
0.005270678949143205
What it means:
Guided Attention Loss — helps force the attention to move diagonally (word-by-word, left-to-right).
✅ Low values mean your attention is learning properly.
Important for good pronunciation and natural prosody.

🎼 avg_decoder_diff_spec_loss
Copy
Edit
0.07337211285318647
🎼 avg_postnet_diff_spec_loss
Copy
Edit
0.07356483169964381
What they mean:
These compare the difference in spectrogram shape (structure) between real and predicted ones.
✅ Lower values mean mel structure is more natural, improving intonation, clarity, and speech patterns.

📷 avg_decoder_ssim_loss
Copy
Edit
0.6625806093215942
📷 avg_postnet_ssim_loss
Copy
Edit
0.739646886076246
What they mean:
SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) between real and generated mel spectrograms.
✅ Higher = better match.
⚠️ Unlike others, this is better when it’s HIGHER (near 1.0 is ideal).
It measures overall pattern similarity — useful for voice naturalness.

📉 avg_loss
Copy
Edit
0.8983699679374695
What it means:
This is the total weighted loss — combines decoder, postnet, stopnet, GA, etc.
✅ This is the main number you want to reduce over time.
Usually the best indicator of overall model improvement.

🎯 avg_align_error
Copy
Edit
0.9564788809844426
What it means:
Measures how well the attention alignment is learning.
This controls how the model matches text tokens to time in audio.
✅ Lower = better alignment = clearer speech.
If this is too high, attention may:
Get stuck
Skip words
Speak out of order
