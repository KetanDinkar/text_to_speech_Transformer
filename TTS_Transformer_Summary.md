# 🎙️ Text-to-Speech Transformer Project Summary

## 🔍 1. Project Introduction

This project builds a modern **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** system using two powerful neural networks: **Tacotron2** for converting text to mel spectrograms, and **HiFi-GAN** for turning those spectrograms into human-like speech.

Together, they form a **two-stage pipeline** that reads any text input and generates realistic voice output.

## 🎯 2. Project Goals

- 🗣️ Generate natural and expressive speech from text  
- 🧠 Use deep learning to learn voice patterns
